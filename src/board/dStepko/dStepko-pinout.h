/*
 * USAGE NOTES
 *
 * Read this first:
 * https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki/Adding-a-new-G2-board-(or-revision)-to-G2#making-a-new-pin-assignment
 *
 *  USAGE:
 *
 *  This file is lays out all the pin capabilities of the SAM3X8C organized by pin number.
 *  Each pin has its associated functions listed at the bottom of the file, and is essentially
 *  immutable for each processor.
 *
 *  To use, assign Motate pin numbers to the first value in the _MAKE_MOTATE_PIN() macro.
 *  ALL PINS MUST BE ASSIGNED A NUMBER, even if they are not used. There will NOT be a
 *  code-size or speed penalty for unused pins, but the WILL be a compiler-failure for
 *  unassigned pins. This new restriction allows for simplification of linkages deep in
 *  Motate.
 */
/*  See motate_pin_assignments.h for pin names to be used int he rest of the G2 code.
 *  EXAMPLES:
 *
 *  *** Vanilla pin example ***
 *
 *      _MAKE_MOTATE_PIN(4, A, 'A', 27);	// SPI0_SCKPinNumber
 *
 *      This assigns Motate pin 4 to Port A, pin 27 (A27)
 *      Look in motate_pin_assignments.h to see that this is kSPI_SCKPinNumber
 *
 *  ** Other pin functions ***
 *
 *      Please look in <Motate>/platform/atmel_sam/motate_chip_pin_functions.h
